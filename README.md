# CS 281: Intro to Computer Systems

## Lab3 -  Prelab

#### Overview

Our objective in this prelab is to lay the groundwork for simplifying boolean expressions in
order to minimize the complexity of the resultant digital logic circuit. We saw in Lab02 that
mechanical adherence to arriving at a boolean expression for a digital logic output from a
complete truth table and yielding a sum-of-products form of resultant expression, while it
works, may not give us the simplest circuit. In this prelab, we will explore two means of
simplifcation.

## Lab03 – K-Map Simplification for an LED-based Circuit

#### Overview


In this lab, we will build a more complex combinational circuit than the sum bit of a full adder that we did in
Lab02. In fact, since it will have three boolean outputs, it is really composed of three combinational circuits.
But we will use simplification techniques that will allow us to “do more with less.” The lab will also lead us
through all the steps of the design process, from high level description of the objective through its realization.

The lab will use the analog input of a potentiometer (one of the dial knobs at the bottom of the breadboard), use
the Arduino to convert that analog input into a binary value in three bits (ranging from decimal 0 to 5), and then
build combinational circuits to control three LED’s that will light up, based on how “high” the potentiometer
is turned.
